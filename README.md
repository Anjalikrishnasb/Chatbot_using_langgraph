LangGraph is a decentralized network that allows developers to create LLM applications with multiple agents that can interact with each other. It's built on top of LangChain and is interoperable with the LangChain ecosystem.LangGraph uses a graph-based representation to define actors, their attributes, relationships, and behaviors. It also includes cyclic data flows, which allow nodes to receive feedback from their previous input and output.
